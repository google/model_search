    This function runs on the chief and runs only once!

    You can create the Phoenix tower. You can use randomness in creating the
    tower, and this class will take care of everything for you (take care that
    the workers have the same graph as chief even in the presence of randomness
    and that if premepteed, the chief will recover the same graph.

    Limitations for implementing this function and using this class:
    The towers must be a Phoenix towers. Meaning, they need to be constructed
    with architectural_utils.construct_tower

    Additionally, tower names must follow the following naming convention:
    `generator_name`_1, `generator_name`_2, etc.

    The above is needed for _build_from_existing_checkpoint.

      trial_mode: the TrialMode for the current Phoenix trial.
      shared_input_tensor: tf.Tensor of type tf.float. It is the input to the

      logits_dimension: The last axis dimension of the logits.
